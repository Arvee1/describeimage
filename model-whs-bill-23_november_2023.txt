They may only be included if the relevant provisions 
of Schedule 1 are included.  
3(2) The words in brackets are optional for jurisdictions. 
They may only be included if the relevant provisions 
of Schedule 1 are included.

authorising 
authority  Each jurisdiction will need to specify the court or 
tribunal or body to be the authorising authority for 
that jurisdiction.  If the term regulator or designated 
court or tribunal or both is to be used in Part 7 
instead of authorising authority, this definition is to 
be deleted.

corresponding 
WHS law  Each jurisdiction will specify the Acts that are to be 
corresponding Acts and may include a power to 
prescribe corresponding Acts by regulation.  
A jurisdiction may extend the operation o f a 
provision that applies to a corresponding WHS law 
to specified laws of the jurisdiction.  This should be 
dealt with separately in the provision or regulations 
under the provision.  
This term is used in the definition of corresponding 
regulator in clause  4, and in sections 85, 90, 113, 
138, 156 and 271 and item  7.2 of Schedule 3 to refer 
to training and other requirements, eligibility criteria, 
appointments, authorisations and information -

this Act  Some jurisdictions may need to disapply the 
meaning of this term in their Interpretation Acts.  
7 A jurisdiction may amend section 7(1) to add 
additional classes of persons to the list of "workers".  
For example, the Commonwealth may add members 
of the defence forces and cadets.  Statutory office 
holders and members of statutory or public 
authorities could also be added. Jurisdictions may 
also sp ecify classes of persons who are to be taken to 
be carrying out work for a business or undertaking 
and persons who are to be taken to be the employer 
of specified classes of persons.  For example  the 
classes of persons specified by a jurisdiction may 
inclu de police officers, defence force members and 
cadets (in the case of the Commonwealth), statutory 
office holders and members of statutory or public 
authorities.  
Each jurisdiction may vary section 7(2)(b) as

9 Jurisdictions may have to disapply the provisions of 
their Interpretations Acts relating to examples and 
notes.  
Jurisdictio ns may use a different style to identify 
examples and notes from that in the model Bill.  
10 Each jurisdiction will, if necessary, enact a provision 
to ensure that the Crown in right of the jurisdiction 
and also in all its other capacities is bound by the  
model provisions.  For example, the Australian 
Capital Territory can omit this provision because of 
the effect of section 121 of its Legislation Act 2001 . 
Some jurisdictions may need to refer to the State 
rather than the Crown throughout the Bill.  
11 Each jurisdiction may insert a local provision 
relating to extraterritorial application including the 
extraterritorial reach of offences.  
12 Each jurisdiction may insert local provisions to 
establish the relationship between the model 
provisions and other A cts in the jurisdiction.  
The Commonwealth will need to deal with the 
operation of Commonwealth and State and Territory 
laws, see for example section 4 of the Occupational 
Health and Safety Act 1991  of the Commonwealth.  
 The Commonwealth may need to draft  provisions to 
deal with matters relating to national security, 
defence and federal police operation, see for example 
sections 6 to 8 of the Occupational Health and 
Safety Act 1991 of the Commonwealth . 
30A Each jurisdiction may insert local provisions to 
create an offence of industrial manslaughter. The 
offence of industrial manslaughter would be in 
addition to the existing offence under section 31 and 
address conduct by a person that represents a gross 
deviation from the reasonable standard of care 
resulting in a work -related fatality.  
The recommended maximum penalty for the offence 
is: 
For an individual —20 years imprisonment.

amendments including the amendment or addition of 
definitions.  
103 Each jurisdiction may need to make appropriate 
amendments to this provision to ensure it conforms 
to local legislation.  
108 Jurisdictions may need to include their own 
definitions of emergency services worker.  
110 A jurisdiction may omit subsection (1)(c) and 
substitute the following for subsection (2):  
"(2) If it is alleged that the discriminatory conduct 
was engaged in for a  prohibited reason, that 
reason is presumed to be the dominant reason 
for that conduct unless the accused proves on 
the balance of probabilities, that the reason was 
not the dom inant reason for the conduct.".  
Part 7  
(and sections 138 
and 142)  A jurisdicti on may use regulator  rather than 
authorising authority  for some or all of the 
provisions of Part 7 and make any necessary 
consequential changes.  This will be necessary for 
jurisdictions where the regulator performs some or 
all of the functions of the auth orising authority.  
116 
(and sections 124, 
131, 133, 137, 138 
and 150)  A State or Territory may insert its relevant industrial 
law. The Commonwealth may omit this definition 
and omit references to relevant State or Territory

172 A jurisdiction may adjust this provision as necessary 
to accord with the legal or legislative or human 
rights principles applying in its jurisdiction.  
A requirement to answer a question, or provide 
information or a document, may be made of a person 
in another jurisdiction where section 172 of the 
corresponding WHS law may be different. Section 
172(3) is to remove doubt that, if a requirement is 
made under the WHS law of a jurisdiction, it is 
section 172 of that WHS law that applies.  
For example, if the regulator in NSW issues a notice 
under section 155 of the NSW law to  a person in the 
ACT, section 172 of the NSW law applies to the 
requirement.  
179 The Commonwealth will need to adjust this 
provision for its jurisdiction.  
184 
(and sections 179, 
220, 262, 270 
and 274) Jurisdictions will need to replace "State" with 
"Terr itory" or "the Commonwealth" as is relevant to 
the jurisdiction.  
A jurisdiction may include an alternative provision

its hum an rights charter or other legislative 
protocols.  
A jurisdiction may amend or remove the offence in 
subsection (4) if this is inconsistent with the powers 
of police in that jurisdiction.  
187 A jurisdiction may omit this provision if this matter 
is dealt with in other laws of its jurisdiction.  
189 A jurisdiction which has a Criminal Code may 
displace the default element of intention that applies 
in that jurisdiction by stating that recklessnes s will 
apply.

office or administer this Act to bring proceedings for 
an offence against this Act, with the written

general statement provision in the Bill) clarifying 
where all or part of an offence attracts strict liability 
or abso lute liability.  
A jurisdiction may need to make adjustments to 
accommodate the procedures and rules in its 
jurisdiction for bringing proceedings in relation to
