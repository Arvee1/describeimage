The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
3 Message from the Federal Safety Commissioner  
In January 2015, a number of  important changes were made to the Australian Government Building 
and Construction Work Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme. The improvements to the Scheme 
are the result of a thorough review and consultation process during 2014. An advisory panel of a ll 
key stakeholders guided the review. The government's objectives were to streamline and modernise 
the scheme while not reducing the safety standards required for accreditation.   
While there has been no reduction in the standards required to become accred ited, these 
improvements will reduce red tape and the compliance burden for building companies that are 
already accredited as well as encouraging more companies to become accredited. This will broaden 
the safety benefits across the industry and improve com petitiveness in the market for 
Commonwealth Government funded construction work. The changes are about increasing support 
and guidance, streamlining the application processes, reducing unnecessary barriers to entry and 
moving to a more targeted compliance model that will better direct resources to those companies 
most requiring it.  
The Scheme is recognised by stakeholders as setting the highest safety standards in Australia and 
there was significant evidence identified in the review to indicate its effecti veness in improving 
safety for individual companies and the industry as a whole. International companies report that it 
reflects global best practice. As well as the terrible personal cost, it is estimated that injuries and 
fatalities in the building indus try have an economic cost of around $6 billion per year. A serious 
workplace accident can have an untold financial and human cost on a building company. The 
Scheme’s best practice, ‘before the event’ approach minimises the risk of safety incidents and 
legislative breaches occurring.   
A key message coming from the 2014 review was the importance of plain English guidance for the 
audit criteria. A number of submissions to the review sought greater clarity of the audit criteria. A 
number of submissions also saw  value in guidance that would assist with consistency of 
interpretation of the criteria.  
The attached, plain English FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines outlines the scope of each criterion, 
provides examples of possible evidence that will and, perhaps most importantly, that won’t, meet 
the criteria. I’m confident this will respond to the demand for documentation that makes it easier to 
understand the audit criteria and their application. There will be on -going consultation and 
improvements to the Guidelines in light of feedback and experience.  
New applicants to the Scheme and those accredited companies seeking reaccreditation will have 
access to an on -line application form that includes the information to be found in these FSC Audit 
Criteria Guidelines. Compa nies preparing for their regular audits will find the information contained 
within the Guidelines a useful reminder in advance of their audit.   
The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines have been developed in consultation with company 
representatives, industry sta keholders and Federal Safety Officers.  I thank them for their input.   The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
4 I take this opportunity to encourage your feedback on your experience of using the FSC Audit 
Criteria Guidelines. If you would like to provide feedback on the Guidelines or would like fu rther 
assistance in preparing for audits, please email ofsc@employment.gov.au * or phone the assist line 
on 1800 652 500.  Further information and fact sheets on the Scheme can be found at

7 What are the OFSC Audit Criteria Guide lines ? 
The OFSC Audit Criteria Guide lines (Guidelines)  will assist companies to complete their application 
for accreditation or reaccreditation and in preparing for audits.  
 
How will the Guidelines  assist me?  
The Guide lines  explain the intent behind each of the Scheme criteria. It also provides ex amples of 
the evidence that you can provide to Federal Safety Officers to demonstrate compliance with 
Scheme criteria.  
 
Importantly, it also provides Notes identifying what won’t  satisfy Scheme criteria.  This information 
can be used by companies to assess  whether their documentation addresses the OFSC Audit criteria.  
 
Explanation of descriptors  
Scope  • A description of the intent behind the criterion, to provide further direction to 
assist with interpretation of the criterion.  
Possible 
evidence  • Examples of possible sources of evidence that could be used to achieve 
conformance with the criterion.   
Notes  • Examples of possible sources of evidence that will not meet the criterion.  
 
A Glossary of Commonly Used terms is available at Appendix A to this Guide.  
 
The documents, procedures and processes described below are provided as guidance for companies.   
The list is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive.  Companies do not need to have everything on the list 
in place, and may also have other means by w hich the criteria can be adequately addressed.  
 
The audit process  
Decisions on what audit criteria are to be verified at an on -site audit will be made by the Office of 
the Federal Safety Commissioner (OFSC) in the first instance and will be determined by a  number of 
factors including works underway on the project site and prior on -site audit results.  
The emphasis is for companies to identify hazards, assess risks to health and safety, and develop and 
implement control measures which use the ‘ hierarchy of co ntrol ’ method to eliminate hazards from 
the workplace or isolate people from the hazard. Where this is not possible, work activities should 
be planned and controlled through company processes to the extent necessary to prevent injury and 
illness.

WHS AUDIT CRITERIA  
WH3 Legal Requirement  
WH3.1  
 
 There is a documented process to ensure all health and safety legislation, codes of practice and Australian standards are ide ntified relevant to:  
• the company operations; and  
• the project/site activities.  
Scope  A documented process for all criteria means that there is a written process (in any format) included in the WHS Management System that clearly describes the 
requirements for the s pecific aspect, and may include the purpose, what must be done and by whom, when and how it is to be done, what tools, materi als and 
documents are needed and how the activity is controlled and recorded. Implementation means the completion of the requiremen ts defined in the WHS Management 
System and associated procedures, including completion of any required tools, forms or documents. Evidence of both of these a spects will be reviewed for all criteria at 
audit.  
This criterion requires the company to define t he process for identifying and recording health and safety legislation, codes of practice and Australian standards 
applicable to the company, and then to adjust the company list/register to reflect the project based health and safety requir ements relevant to the scope of works for 
the project.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Company legal register.  
• Specific prompts for identifying health and safety legislation and other requirements.  
• Reference to the inputs and methods to obtain legislative and other requirements.  
• Project level process to review company register and make it specific to the needs of the project (i.e. removal or strike -through of non -relevant reference 
documents).  
Notes  1. A subscription service alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. A sin gle register for both the company and the project with no adjustment (i.e. the exact same register) will not satisfy this cri terion.  The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
10  
WH3.2  
 There is a documented process to ensure all current health and safety legislation, codes of practice and Australian standards  relevant to the project are readily 
available on site and workers are informed of the method of access.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to provide access at the site level to hard -copy or electronic versions of the health and safety legislation, codes 
of practice and Australian standards documents identified as relevant to the project in  WH3.1, and the process for communicating to all workers how to gain access to 
the documents.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Evidence of access at site level.  
• Communication of access provisions at induction.  
• Site notice board content.  
Notes  1. A subscription service alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. A process for communication that does not systematically cover all workers will not satisfy this criterion.  
3. Access to the documents alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH3.3  There is a docume nted process to ensure changes to health and safety legislation, codes of practice and Australian standards relevant to the c ompany and project 
are reviewed and processes updated as required.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process for identifying changes to the applicable legal requirements, reviewing the impact of any identified change and 
the prompt to review the relevant procedures that may be affected.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Subscription to on -line update services.  
• Legal re gister at company/project levels.  
• Process to review the company/project legal registers at designated frequencies to identify potential changes.  
• Corrective action or change management process/records.  
• Process to review the legal registers.  
Notes  1. A subscription service alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. Changes to the legal register/references without review of the relevant procedural impacts will not satisfy this criterion.  The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
11 WH12 Hazard Identification Risk Assessment and Control (HIRAC)  
WH12.1  There is a documented HIRAC methodology.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to identify and record the potential hazards, assess the level of r isk associated with each of the potential 
hazards and define the controls necessar y to manage the hazards. This must include a process to calculate the levels of risk and determine control measures as per 
AS/NZS ISO 31000.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Risk Matrix.  
• Likelihood (probability and exposure) and consequence descriptor.  
• Risk Registers/Risk Assessments.  
• Other HIRAC outputs e.g. SWMS.  
Notes  1. A risk matrix alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. Company HIRAC outputs not using the company HIRAC methodology will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH12.2  
 There is a documented process to ensure the project HIRAC process is undertaken by personnel trained in the use of the company’s HIRAC methodology and tools.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to make sure that all personnel who are completing or participating in projec t HIRAC processes are trained in the company’s specific 
HIRAC methods and associated forms and tools. Trained means that a worker has been trained internally, consistent with company defined requirements. Evidence of 
specific content delivered or communica ted is required.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Training program/outline including the company’s HIRAC methods, and associated forms and tools.  
• Company training matrix/register.  
• Completed training records (internal and/or external).  
Notes  1. Generic Risk Management training alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. Training in the Risk Matrix alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
3. Generic induction training that doesn’t include company specific HIRAC methodology and tools will not satisfy this criterion.  
 The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
12 WH12.3  There is a documented process to ensure project specific HIRAC is conducted.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to make sure that all of  the potential health and safety hazards associated with the project scope and activities are identified, risk 
assessment is conducted for each identified hazard, and the required controls are documented. In documenting the assessment a nd controls there sh ould be a clear link 
back to the identified hazard, and therefore grouping of the hazards will generally not achieve the required outcome for this  criterion.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Project Risk Assessments/Project Risk Registers.  
• Project risk assessment contr ols included into SWMS.  
Notes  1. A generic risk assessment will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. Potential hazards that do not have commensurate control measures will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH12.4  There is a documented process to liaise with client/public/other entities to implement a HIRAC process for any hazards impacting any of the parties.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to identify and interact with all relevant stakeholders, and to man age the hazards that may impact the 
stakeholders or the project.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Initial stakeholder meeting minutes with client/public/other entities prior to project commencement.  
• Project Risk Registers/Project Risk Assessments.  
• Regular stakeholder meeting m inutes.  
• Information drops to residents.  
Notes  1. Assessment of hazards without documented liaison alone (and vice versa) will not satisfy this criterion.  The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
13  
WH12.5  There is a documented process to define the company’s acceptable risk level and management actions to be taken if assessed risk is higher than that level.  
Scope  This criterion is about an escalation process where risk is assessed as too high. This criterion requires the company to defi ne the process to classify the assessed risk 
score/level and define actions to be undertaken to treat the risk including acceptance /tolerance criteria and actions to be undertaken based on the classification. The 
company is first required to determine the risk level/ranking/score (e.g. extreme, high, medium, low or 1 -5, 6-8, 9-12 etc.) for each hazard based on the likelihood and 
conse quence assessment. The company is then required to set their unacceptable risk level – e.g. anything high or greater is unacceptable. Finally, the company is 
required to define management actions to be taken where risk is assessed as being above the accept able level (e.g. cease work, senior management sign off required, 
permit to work system required, additional supervision required etc.).  
Possible  
Evidence  • Process to evaluate risk assessment outcomes and apply control actions based on the classification  level.  
• Actions defined are utilised when developing controls to manage the hazard.  
Notes  1. Definition of risk levels alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. Application of the Hierarchy of Control alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH12.6  
 There is a  documented process to ensure  control measures are established for identified hazards in accordance with:  
• the Hierarchy of Control; and  
• applicable legislation, codes of practice and Australian standards.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to make sure the Hierarchy of Control is used to make decisions on the level of controls to be used, and that controls developed  are 
consistent with the relevant requirements outlined in the legislation, codes of practice, and Australian standards.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Project Risk Assessment/Project Risk Register details controls using the Hierarchy of Control.  
• HIRAC methodology incorporates the Hierarchy of Control.  
• Requirements of legislation, codes of practice and Australian standards are incorpora ted into controls.  
• Review criteria for subcontractor procedures incorporate checks for use of the Hierarchy of Control and relevant legal requir ements being incorporated into 
control measures.  
Notes  1. Inclusion of the Hierarchy of Control in the HIRAC metho dology alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
14 WH12.7  There is a documented process to evaluate the effectiveness of company, project and task specific HIRAC processes.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to review its HIRAC methodology to verify that company, project and task based HIRAC processes remain effective.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Records of review of HIRAC procedures/methodology at various company, project and task levels.  
• Records of review of HIRAC processes and outputs e.g. management review, annual system review, WHSMS audits, review of Risk Assessments/Risk Registers, 
Project Safety Plans, Task Observations, SWMS Reviews.  
Notes  1. A review of outputs (Risk Assessments/Risk Registers, Project Safety Plans, Task Observations, S WMS Reviews) alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH13 Emergency Preparedness and Response  
WH13.1  There is a documented process to identify potential emergency situations for the project.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to identify all of the foreseeable project -specific emergencies that may occur, and the method of recording 
them.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Emergency Risk Assessment/Register.  
• Emergency Management Plan (or similar).  
• Listing of emergencies within Project Safety Plan or Project Risk Register.  
• Generic Emergency Management Plan updated with project specific emergency situations and actions.  
Notes  1. A generic Emergency Management Plan/Register will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. The client Emergency Management Plan alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH13.2  There is a documented process to ensure procedures/plans are developed and regularly reviewed for identified emergency situa tions  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to develop specific emergency procedures for each of the identified  emergencies (which may be 
incorporated into an Emergency Plan), including the process for reviewing the procedures to make sure they remain valid for the project activities.  The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
15 WH13.2  There is a documented process to ensure procedures/plans are developed and regularly reviewed for identified emergency situa tions  
Possible  
Evidence  • Procedures for each identified potential emergency.  
• Emergency Plan, with procedure and prompts for review.  
• Completed Emergency Plan/Procedure reviews.  
Notes  1. A generic Emergency Management Plan/Register will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. The client Emergency Management Plan alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
3. A single Emergency Evacuation plan (i.e. the same for all potential emergencies) will not satisfy this c riterion.  
4. Emergency contact details alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH13.3  There is a documented process to ensure emergency response arrangements are communicated to all personnel and visitors.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to make sure that all workers on site, and any visitors, have been informed of the emergency procedures fo r 
the site.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Site Induction content.  
• Visitor induction.  
• Site Noticeboard/sign in area contents.  
Notes  1. A site no ticeboard with the emergency contact details alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH13.4  There is a documented process to ensure designated emergency personnel for the project:  
• have been inducted in the site -specific emergency procedures/plans; and  
• have obtained any qualification or formal training defined by the company as required to fulfill the role.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to make sure that the personnel who have been allocated emergency r esponse roles for the site have been 
trained in the site emergency procedures/plans, and hold other relevant qualifications and for mal training as defined by the company (e.g. emergency warden, first aid, 
confined space etc.).  The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
16 WH13.4  There is a documented process to ensure designated emergency personnel for the project:  
• have been inducted in the site -specific emergency procedures/plans; and  
• have obtained any qualification or formal training defined by the company as required to fulfill the role.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Company/project training matrix/register.  
• Completed training records (internal and/or external).  
• Emergency Management Plan (or similar).  
• Emergency contact details.  
Notes  1. Generic Fire Warden training alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. Awareness training in the site emergency procedures/plans alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH13.5  There is a documented process to ensure emergency practice drills:  
• are scheduled and carried out on site;  
• are scenario based and test a variety of the identified potential emergency situations;  
• are recorded and evaluated for effectiveness; and  
• incorporate a process for the identification and ma nagement of corrective actions.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to make sure that emergency procedures/plans are scheduled and prac ticed on site, that the drills are based 
on the identified project -specific situations, and  that the results are recorded and reviewed for any necessary improvements. Not all scenarios have to be practiced; 
however, more than just generic evacuation is required. Frequency is as determined by the company.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Emergency drill schedule.  
• Emergency drill records.  
• Corrective Actions raised, based on drill outcomes.  
Notes  1. An annual drill where project duration is typically less than 12 months will not satisfy this criterion.  
2. Generic evacuation drills alone will not satisfy this cri terion.  
3. Emergency drill records without analysis of the effectiveness of the drill will not satisfy this criterion.  
4. Conducting a drill alone will not satisfy this criterion where there is no evidence of a schedule and requirements for freque ncy. The FSC Audit Criteria Guidelines  
17  
WH13.6  
 There is a documented process to ensure a qualified person identifies site first aid equipment and requirements in accordance  with relevant legislation, codes of 
practice and Australian standards.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to make sure that a person who holds the required qualification (as  defined by the company) has completed a 
site-specific review of the first aid requirements (in accordance with the Code of Practic e) and has made sure that the first aid arrangements on site are in line with the 
review. A single assessment covering the requirements of this criterion as well as WH13.7 is acceptable so long as all requir ements are captured. Qualified means a 
person who  holds a recognised degree, certificate or professional standing relevant to the activity or works.  
Possible  
Evidence  • Company training matrix/register.  
• Completed training records.  
• Project first aid assessment.  
• First aid arrangements on site are as specified in the assessment.  
• On-site first aid equipment and provisions match what has been identified in the assessment.  
Notes  1. The presence of first aid persons and equipment alone will not satisfy this criterion.  
 
WH13.7  There is a documented process to ensure a competent person identifies site emergency equipment and requirements.  
Scope  This criterion requires the company to define the process to make sure that a person who holds the required training (as defi ned by the company) has completed  a site -
specific review of the emergency requirements and has made sure that the right equipment is located on site to cater for the identified emergencies that may occur on 
the project. Emergency equipment may include extinguishers, equipment specific to potential site emergencies such as retrieval of arrested fall, confined spaces, 
working around live electrical equipment, stretcher, method of raising alarm, personal floatation devices, remote site requir ements etc., and should consider the 
placement of s uch equipment. Competent means that a person has been deemed to meet the combination of licences, qualifications, training and instruction as defined
